The Interactive Networking Tutor is a complete, self-contained, single-page web application designed to teach computer networking concepts. It guides learners from foundational topics like the OSI model to advanced, real-world subjects like cloud networking, automation, and Zero Trust architecture.

The core learning experience is enhanced by **Google's Gemini AI**, which provides a global, context-aware tutor to answer questions and an in-lab assistant to explain complex calculations and security policies.

## üöÄ Live Demo

A live version of this project is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

You only need two things installed on your computer:
* A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
* **Python 3**.

### 2. Configuration (‚ùóCRITICAL STEP)

To enable the AI features, you **must** add your own Google AI API key.

1.  **Get a free API key** from **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)**.
2.  Open the file: **`js/config.js`** in the project folder.
3.  Replace the placeholder text `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with the key you just copied.
    ```javascript
    // Before:
    const API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE";

    // After:
    const API_KEY = "AIzaSyB...your...actual...key...here...";
    ```
4.  Save the file. The AI features will now be active.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning:** Never share your API key publicly or commit the `config.js` file with your key in it to a public Git repository. If you are using Git, you should add `js/config.js` to your `.gitignore` file immediately.

### 3. Running Locally

Because the application loads files dynamically, you cannot just open `index.html` in your browser. You must serve it from a local web server.

1.  **Open your Terminal or Command Prompt.**
2.  **Navigate to the project folder.** (Tip: Type `cd ` then drag the folder onto the terminal window and press Enter).
    ```sh
    cd path/to/your/interactive-networking-tutor
    ```
3.  **Run the local server command** that you confirmed works for your system:
    ```sh
    python -m http.server
    ```
4.  **Open the application.** The terminal will show a message like `Serving HTTP on :: port 8000...`. Open your web browser and go to this address:
    [**http://localhost:8000**](http://localhost:8000)
